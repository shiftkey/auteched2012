Because I'm a sucker for research, here's a bunch of resources which might interest you in addition to the things I discussed in the talk.

 - [CLR and the Windows Runtime](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=243099) - want to read more about how the CLR language projections work on Windows Runtime? This is the doc for you. Warning: some heavy stuff.

 - [OAuth.WinRT](https://github.com/shiftkey/oauth-winrt) - migrating the [OAuth C# Sample](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/csharp/OAuthBase.cs) to a Windows Runtime component. I included a summary of the changes necessary.
 
 - [Cartoonify](https://github.com/shiftkey/cartoonify) - mixing C++ and JavaScript together in a Windows 8 app to do some image processing.

 - [Win32 and COM for Windows Store Apps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br205757.aspx) - that's right, you've got a subset of Win32 APIs available when doing Windows Store apps.
